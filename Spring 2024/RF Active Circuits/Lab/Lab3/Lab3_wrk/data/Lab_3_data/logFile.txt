Warning detected by hpeesofsim during DC analysis `SP1'.
    Circuit converged after a virtual resistance of 1 TOhms 
    was added between each node and ground, and a virtual 
    resistance of 1 pOhms was inserted in each current branch. 
    Possible causes include floating nodes or missing ground.


SP SP1[1] <Lab3_lib:Lab-3:schematic>   freq=(0 Hz->1 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    A virtual resistance of 1 TOhms was added between each node and ground,
    and a virtual resistance of 1 pOhms was inserted in each current branch,
    during AC/SP analysis at 0 Hz.
