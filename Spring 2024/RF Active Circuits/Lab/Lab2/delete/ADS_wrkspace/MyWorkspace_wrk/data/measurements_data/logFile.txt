SP SP1[1] <MyLibrary_lib:measurements:schematic>   freq=(100 MHz->10 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `U:/Spring 2024/RF Active Circuits/Lab/Lab2/lab2/lab2/MATCHING_CIRCIUT.S2P'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
